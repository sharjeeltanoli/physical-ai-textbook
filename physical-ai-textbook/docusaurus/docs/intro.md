# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to this comprehensive textbook on **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**. This course bridges the gap between digital intelligence and physical embodiment, exploring how AI systems interact with and control robotic hardware in the real world.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents the convergence of artificial intelligence with robotics, enabling machines to:
- Perceive and understand the physical world through sensors
- Make intelligent decisions in real-time
- Execute physical actions through actuators and manipulators
- Learn from physical interactions and experiences

Unlike purely digital AI systems, Physical AI must contend with the challenges of the real world: physics, uncertainty, latency, and mechanical constraints.

## Course Overview

This textbook is structured into four comprehensive modules spanning 13 weeks:

### Introduction (Weeks 1-2)
Foundation concepts, development environment setup, and course roadmap.

### Module 1: ROS 2 (Weeks 3-5)
Master the Robot Operating System 2, the industry-standard framework for building robot applications.

### Module 2: Gazebo & Unity (Weeks 6-7)
Learn robot simulation using Gazebo and Unity, enabling safe testing before real-world deployment.

### Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac (Weeks 8-10)
Explore NVIDIA's Isaac platform for GPU-accelerated robotics simulation and AI training.

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action Models (Weeks 11-13)
Dive into cutting-edge VLA models that enable robots to understand natural language commands and execute complex tasks.
